</h3>
<p>
HTML is used to describe the content of pages and its usually what people are talking about when they mention “a web page”. In HTML, we will express things like “this is a paragraph” or “this is an important word”. We aren't concerned in HTML how those things look. We will cover the basics of HTML further in the unit Markup and HTML.

<h3 style="color:red;font-family:mistral;font-weight:bold-italics;text-decoration:underline;">CSS:</h3>
<p>We can use CSS to suggest appearances for the pieces of content we have created in HTML. For example, we can express ideas like “all paragraphs should have this font size” with CSS. We will introduce CSS in the unit Stylesheets.

<h3 style="color:red;font-family:mistral;font-weight:bold-italics;text-decoration:underline;">JavaScript:</h3>
<p>With HTML and CSS we can make simple web pages, but they don't do anything. In order to control the behaviour of our pages, we need a third technology: JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that is embedded in web browsers. It can be used to insert logic and behaviour into web pages.
